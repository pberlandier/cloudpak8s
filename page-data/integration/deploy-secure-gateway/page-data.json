Note - you do not need to install this \nchart unless you are using DataPower as a standalone capability.  \nWhen you install API Connect, it installs its own version of this chart \nas part of the APIC Cluster.\n\n### Prepare Installation\n\n1. **Change project to eventstreams**\n   ```\n   oc project datapower\n   ```\n\n### Begin Installation  \n1. Go to CP4I Platform Home. Click **Create instance** inside the \n**DataPower** tile.  \n2. A window will pop up with a description of the requirements for \ninstalling. Click **Continue** to the helm chart deployment configuration.     \n3. Click **Overview** to view the chart information and pre-reqs that were \ncovered in [Prepare Installation](#prepare-installation).\n4. Click **Configure**\n5. Enter the Helm release name. In our example, **datapower**\n6. Enter Target Namespace - **datapower**\n7. Select a Cluster - **local-cluster**.\n8. Check the license agreement. \n9. Under Parameters click **All Parameters** to expand. \n   1. Ingress - icp-proxy address defined during icp / common-services \n   installation - icp-proxy.&lt;openshift-router-domain&gt;  \n   2. Image Pull Secret - Set to `ibm-entitlement-key` if using entitled \n   registry or if offline use the `deployer-dockercfg-XX` secret in your \n   datapower namespace.  Use `oc get secrets` to get the exact value for \n   your environment.\n10.  Scroll down to External access settings - enter the proxy \naddress - **icp-proxy.&lt;openshift-router-domain&gt;.**\n11. Note:  If you want to enable access to the WebUI and XML/Rest \nInterfaces for your datapower instance, you will need to change those \nmanually.  Otherwise, they will default to disabled.\n12. Scroll to the bottom. Click **Install**.\n\n### Validate Installation  \n1. check pods using the command line\n   ```\n   oc get pods -n datapower\n   NAME                                      READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\n   dp-1-ibm-datapower-icp4i-fb888677-mvd9q   1/1       Running   0          3m\n   ```\n \n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"c33e12fd3fda936a4c7ffeaa4d90c743","counter":238,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"DataPower Gateway","weight":600},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: DataPower Gateway\nweight: 600\n---\n\n- [Introduction](#introduction)\n- [Prepare Installation](#prepare-installation)\n- [Begin Installation](#begin-installation)\n- [Validate Installation](#validate-installation)\n\n### Introduction\nThis page contains guidance on how to configure the Datapower Gateway \nrelease for both on-prem and IBM Cloud.
